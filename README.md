Git is a distributed version control system  that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).
Git is a fast, versatile, highly scalable, and free open source VCS. Its main author is Linux Torvalds, creator of Linux.

What is version control?
A version control system (VCS) is a program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files. One of the goals of a VCS is to easily recover previous versions of individual files or the entire project. Another goal is to allow multiple members of a team to work on a project, even on the same files, at the same time without affecting each other's work.

Another name for a VCS is a software configuration management (SCM) system. The two terms are often used interchangeably; in fact, the official Git documentation is located at git-scm.com. Technically, version control is just one of the procedures involved in SCM. A VCS can be used for projects other than software, including books and online tutorials.

With a VCS, you can:
View all changes made to the project, when the changes were made, and who made them.
Include a message with each change to explain the reasons.
Recover previous versions of the entire project or individual files.
Create branches, where changes can be made experimentally. This feature allows several different change sets (for example, features or bug fixes) to be worked on at the same time, possibly by different people, without affecting the main branch. Later you can merge the changes you want to keep in the main branch.
